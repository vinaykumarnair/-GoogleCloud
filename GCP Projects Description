As part of this program, I had the opportunity to acquire knowledge of the fundamentals of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Cloud Computing, in addition to implementing mini-projects based on real-world scenarios, such as:


1. Automation in Google Cloud using Python - IAM Service Accounts.
2. Implementation of private communication in a MultiCloud environment (AWS and GCP) in a 100% automated way using Terraform.
3. Lift & Shift + Application Modernization: Converting a legacy application to run in containers on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using Anthos.
4. Migration of Intercontinental VM (USA Region -> Australia Region) using Storage Snapshot through the internal private network of Google Cloud in less than 30 minutes.
5. Implementation of Cloud Load Balancing between Regions in the USA and Europe for global high availability and intelligent traffic distribution based on user proximity and location.
6. Migration of Application and Standalone Database in VM (Google Compute Engine) to modern containerized architecture, using the managed services Google Kubernetes Engine (APP) + Cloud SQL (DB) in HA.
7. Implementation of Corporate Training Portal on Google Cloud Platform using Deployment Manager, Google Compute Engine & Cloud Storage.
8. Final Project: Implementation of a Web Application to automate talent onboarding using HTML / CSS / JS / BS (Front-end) + Python Flash (Back-end) with Cloud Storage and Cloud Functions 100% Serverless.
